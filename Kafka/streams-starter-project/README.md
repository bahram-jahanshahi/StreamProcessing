# Stream Starter Project
### The first try to set up a sample quick start Kafka stream project.

STEP 1: Get and Install Kafka
Go to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) website and download Kafka version 3.0.0 (Scala 2.12).
Then extract the compressed file in a folder. Now Kafka is installed!


## Run The Kafka Environment
*NOTE: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed* :wink:
